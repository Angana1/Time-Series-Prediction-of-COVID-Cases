The project involves the analysis of the daily Covid-19 cases across 180 countries over one year to forecast rate of spread. The steps in our analysis involved:
* Categorising the phases of Covid-19 increase as Fast, Moderate and Slow using the [Knee Detection Algorithm](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dw8qgYcGVBLWmd386t7vlqKQogS8X1KC/view?usp=sharing).
* Analysing the relationship between Phase change and NPIs (Non-pharmaceutical interventions) implemented by the government. Please find detailed analysis in the [Phase-NPI Analysis Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f7dFaW3-JOGoes4Kt2zgIm0UwZbIv8qquTR_25pyt5A/edit?usp=sharing).
* Implementing Phase-Specific LSTM Models to predict the rate of spread of Covid-19 in the fast, moderate and slow phases respectively, and compared the accuracy metrics of each model.
